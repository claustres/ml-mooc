    "\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we are going to explore the different types of Compound Data Types such as set, tuples, lists, dictionaries and the various concepts associated with these data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "First question which would arise in anyone's mind would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the meaning of compound data types?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a composite data type or compound data type is any data type which can be constructed in a program using the programming language's primitive data types and other composite types\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists, sets, tuples and dictionaries are also called data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data. Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference:\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range\n",
    "<br>https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we'll learn about the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lists\n",
    "2. Tuples\n",
    "3. Dictionaries\n",
    "4. Sets \n",

    "Lists are collection of objects which can be of same or different datatype.\n",
    "<br> Lists can be very useful in many situations.\n",
    "<font color=green>### Example</font>\n",
    "<br> Suppose in a class, teacher has to store information of a student of the form name, roll number, marks then its convenient to store in 3 variables but suppose there are 25 students then the number of variables will be 25 x 3 = 75,\n",
    "this will increase a toll on the teacher, so its better to store in 3 lists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier when discussing strings we introduced the concept of a sequence in Python. On the same lines we can say that lists are general form of sequence in Python. Unlike strings, they are mutable, meaning the **elements inside a list can be changed!**\n",
    "\n",
    "By mutable we mean that, the elements in the list can deleted, swapped, replaced also new elements can be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with another programming language, you might start to draw parallels between arrays in another language and lists in Python. Lists in Python however, tend to be more flexible than arrays in other languages for a two good reasons: they have no fixed size (meaning we don't have to specify how big a list will be), and they have no fixed type constraint (like we've seen above).\n",
